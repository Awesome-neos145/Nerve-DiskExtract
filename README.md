# Nerve-DiskExtract
Python files to extract ".disk" images from the Nerve Software PS3 and XBLA releases of DOOM, DOOM 2, and Wolfenstein 3D.
# Did I write this?
No. I'm too stupid to even code a full program in Python. However, I did use info from [https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Diskfile] to help me through this process of writing it through Copilot.
